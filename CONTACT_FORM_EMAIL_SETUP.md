# ðŸ“§ Getting Contact Form Messages to Your Email

## How It Works with Netlify:

### Step 1: Deploy to Netlify
When you deploy your portfolio to Netlify, the contact form automatically becomes active.

### Step 2: Form Notifications Setup
1. **Go to your Netlify dashboard**
2. **Click on your site**
3. **Go to "Forms" tab**
4. **Click "Settings & usage"**
5. **Add email notification**:
   - Email: `bnithyashree16@gmail.com`
   - Subject: "New Portfolio Contact Form Submission"

### Step 3: What Happens When Someone Submits:

1. **Visitor fills out form** on your portfolio
2. **Netlify receives the submission**
3. **You get an email** with:
   - Sender's name
   - Sender's email
   - Subject
   - Message content
   - Timestamp
4. **You can reply directly** from your email

### Example Email You'll Receive:
```
From: notifications@netlify.com
To: bnithyashree16@gmail.com
Subject: New Portfolio Contact Form Submission

Name: John Recruiter
Email: john@company.com
Subject: Job Opportunity
Message: Hi Nithyashree, I saw your portfolio and would like to discuss a Data Engineering position...
